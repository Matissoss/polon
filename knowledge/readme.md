## about

This directory contains useful info on EXTERNAL standards (as well as basics of them) like CPU ISA's (x86, SPARC, etc.), ABI's (like SysV), Output file formats (like ELF), etc. 
that should be used as "official" reference for work in POLON project. If you didn't find something you're looking for open an issue or a pull request and we'll try to add it here.
